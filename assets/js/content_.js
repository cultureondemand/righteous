<p>Educators, families, and policymakers have known for some time that the academic achievement gap is in large part due to an opportunity gap. Experts agree that accessible, high quality after school and summer learning programs are an essential set of opportunities that can help to close the achievement gap and create more equitable educational outcomes for kids where differences in race, culture, and family income have too often been predictive of acute disparities. For after school and summer programs to do their work, they need to meet kids where they are: in schools, and where kids live, play, and socialize.  Right now, some of the most important work to meet kids where they are with expanded learning opportunities is happening where they live, in affordable and public housing settings.</p>
<p>
The Partnership for Children & Youth (PCY), through our HousED Initiative, has spent years working with housing providers throughout California, enhancing the quality of learning in programs that collectively serve over 40,000 kids. HousED has also partnered with visionary leaders in housing to plan the future of capacity building, quality improvement, and enhanced public support for housing’s role in building greater equity in academic and life outcomes for young people from under-resourced families.</p>
<p>
In 2015, we brought together a diverse group of housing agencies and educators to meet an ambitious goal: establish standards for quality expanded learning programs that speak to the unique needs and challenges of prodviding services to youth in public and affordable housing communities. The Quality Standards for Expanded Learning in California produced by the California Department of Education and the California Afterschool Network served as a strong foundation for us and our early partners; the National Afterschool Association, Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, The David P. Weikart Center for Youth Program Quality, and the Housing Development Consortium to use, adapt, and share our work.</p>
<p>
These standards are a groundbreaking step forward. We are already seeing the impact these ideas are having on expanded learning programs in housing, and we look forward to hearing how you will use them. Every program is different, and we believe that these standards will serve as a guide that staff at each program will adapt to meet their unique needs.</p>
<P>
We hope you will join us, and make these standards your own. Together, we will change the lives of youth in expanded learning programs across the country. Together, we will build pathways out of poverty.

Expanded Learning programs should be student-centered, results-driven, include community partners, and complement but not replicate learning activities in the regular school day/ year. Children and youth spend more time out of school than in, and learning is not restricted to the classroom.<img src='assets/images/cycle.png' border='0' alt='Cycle of Quality'>"
